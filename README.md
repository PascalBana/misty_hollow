The purpose of this game is to both practice the ruby skills of both
Nic and Pascal but also to fill out and explore Misty Hollow.

The planning of this project  will begin on the 8th of December with
absolutly no time frame so who when this will be finished if it ever does
get finished lol.

fuuuuuuuuuuuuck... I want donuts


if combat is implemented it will obviously have to be much simpler than
combat in dnd.

I think a good starting point would be under

standing all the objects,
statistics and abilities the player would have. going through and understanding what would be visible in the console and what would happening
behind the scenes to make that possible.

probably starting with abilities such as move and talk, then moving to
statistics like health, and finally going over basic objects the player would
have at the start of the game and what they might use them for.
then repeating that process until the player has enough info to
really start playing the game while being careful we don't start with
to much stuff to simplify the rest of the creation of the game.

after that I think it would be best to start with the players first
conversation and understanding the long term affects it will have on
the game as a whole.
